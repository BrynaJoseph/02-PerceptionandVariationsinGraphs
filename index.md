## Limits to Distinct Perception

* Ability to distinguish diminishes with increase in alternatives
* ~ 8 different hues, 4 different orientations and 4 different sizes
* Number of visual attributes at a time also severely limited (1 at a time)

## Representation of quantitative values

* points
* lines
* bars
* boxes
* shapes with varying 2-D areas
* shapes with varying color intensity

---
## Points - scatter and dot

---

## Lines
Connect individual data values and/or display overall trend

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-2.png) 

---
## Bars
line + width with no information = possibly better interpretation
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-3.png) 
<br> Always start with a base of ZERO for Bar Charts

---
## Boxes

## Shapes with 2-D areas (area-graphs)

## Shapes with 2-D or Bars?

## Encoding Categorical Variables
 
 * 2D position
 * Hue
 * Point Shape
 * Fill pattern
 * Line Style

## Relationships usually displayed in graphs

* Time Series: Changes in variable(s) over time (Change, rise, increase, fluctuate, grow, decline, decrease, trend)
* Ranking (larger/smaller/equal to/greater/lesser)
* Part-to-whole (rate/percent/share of total/accounts for n percent)
* Deviation (absolute/percentage/rate of deviations from a reference value,)
* Distribution (frequency, distribution, range, concentration, normal)
* Correlation (how variables covary - increases/decreases/changes with, caused by, affected by)
* Geospatial (spatial, geographical - county/city/region/state/...)
* Nominal comparison (simple comparison of categorical variables - alphabetical/ascending/descending)

## Part-to-Whole
Pie-charts, for their disadvantages, are easily recognized. Can use bars close to each other.
